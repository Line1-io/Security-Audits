## Audit Summary

### Version History

- **V1.0:** Initial Report - 3rd October 2024

### Scope of Work

The audit focused on a thorough security assessment of the Rust-based Smart Contracts provided by FalXDex. This included identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring code integrity, and verifying adherence to security best practices. The auditing process followed a structured and methodical approach:

1. **Pre-Audit Review:** Review of specifications, source code, and supplementary documentation.
2. **Manual Code Review:** Detailed inspection of the source code to identify logic flaws, access control issues, and susceptibility to known exploits.
3. **Specification Comparison:** Verification of code alignment with specifications and functional requirements.
4. **Test Coverage Analysis:** Analysis of test coverage to identify untested paths.
5. **Symbolic Execution and Automated Tools:** Simulation of inputs and execution paths using symbolic execution and automated tools.
6. **Best Practices Review:** Evaluation of the smart contractâ€™s architecture for efficiency, maintainability, and security.
7. **Actionable Recommendations:** Specific itemized recommendations provided upon audit completion.
