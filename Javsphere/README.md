# Javsphere Smart Contract Audit by Line1.io

This repository contains the security audit report for the Javsphere project, a next-generation Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This audit was conducted by **Line1.io** to ensure the security and integrity of the Javsphere smart contracts and codebase.

## Project Overview

### About the Project

Javsphere offers the next generation of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) products. The ecosystem is built upon the foundation of DeFiChain, a blockchain based on Bitcoin code that brings native DeFi capabilities to Bitcoin. On top of native DeFi, DeFi Meta Chain (DMC) was added as a functionality upgrade. DMC enables projects to build on the EVM-compatible layer quickly and deploy dApps and Smart Contracts (SC). Through the DMC, DeFiChain connects Bitcoin with Ethereum.

- **Chain:** To Be Announced (TBA)
- **Language:** Solidity

### Scope of Work

The audit focused on a thorough security assessment of the Solidity Smart Contracts provided by Javsphere. This included identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring code integrity, and verifying adherence to security best practices. The auditing process followed a structured and methodical approach:

1. **Pre-Audit Review:** Review of specifications, source code, and supplementary documentation.
2. **Manual Code Review:** Detailed inspection of the source code to identify logic flaws, access control issues, and susceptibility to known exploits.
3. **Specification Comparison:** Verification of code alignment with specifications and functional requirements.
4. **Test Coverage Analysis:** Analysis of test coverage to identify untested paths.
5. **Symbolic Execution and Automated Tools:** Simulation of inputs and execution paths using symbolic execution and automated tools.
6. **Best Practices Review:** Evaluation of the smart contractâ€™s architecture for efficiency, maintainability, and security.
7. **Actionable Recommendations:** Specific itemized recommendations provided upon audit completion.

### Imported Packages

The audit reviewed the following dependencies:

- `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20BurnableUpgradeable.sol`
- `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol`
- `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol`
- `@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol`
- (and several more listed in the full report)
